# deadenylation kinetics

## Welcome!

This package enables the user to simulate and/or fit deadenylation mechanisms to FRET assay data in order to determine the most likely case and simultaneously quantify RNA poly(A) tail lengths as a function of time, in response to the action of a deadenylase enzyme on poly(A) RNA.
